/**
 * The international celestial reference system (ICRS). Its center is located at the solar system barycenter.
 *
 * The ICRS constitutes the set of prescriptions and conventions together with the modelling required to define at any
 * time a triad of axes. The System is realised by VLBI estimates of equatorial coordinates of a set of extragalactic
 * compact radio sources, the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF). The ICRS can be connected to the
 * International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) by use of the IERS Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP).
